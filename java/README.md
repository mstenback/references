practice_java
=============
This public repository contains a small collection of Java-applications that I wrote as practice and reference. 
This repository currently contains following applications.

1-hello
-------
The simplest of runnable Java-applications, Hello World. Demonstrates the bare minimum application structure.

2-fibonacci
-----------
This application calculates the first 20 Fibonacci numbers. Simple uses of variables, for-loops and if-structures.
There are two alternative implementations.
* `Fibonacci.java` - a straightforward, yet a bit more complex solution without recursive method.
* `FibonacciRecursion.java` - a simpler solution that uses a recursive method. 

3-fibonacci_index
-----------------
This application calculates `F(_n_)` for the given value of _n_, when _n &ge; 0_. In other words, `F(6)` equals `8` as it is 
the 8th number in the sequence. The application also demonstrates how to read user input from command line parameter with
rudimentary input validations.
