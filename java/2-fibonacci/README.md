2-fibonacci
===========
There are two alternative implementations for the Fibonacci calculation.

Fibonacci.java
--------------
Non-recursive implementation that quite straightforward, but a little longer and complex than
the alternative implementation that uses recursive method. However, comparing these two
implementations might help some people to better understand recursion. Maybe?

FibonacciRecursive.java
-----------------------
The proper implementation for `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` calculation. While recursion can sometimes
be a little challenging to figure out, when done right it tends to result in more elegant and 
simpler code.
