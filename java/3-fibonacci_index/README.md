3-fibonacci_index
=================
A variation from previous *2-fibonacci script*. Instead of listing multiple Fibonacci values, 
it prints out the specific number for the given value of `F(n)`. For example, `F(6)` equals `8`.

This script processes user input as command line parameter. There must be one command line
parameter, which is either a zero or a positive integer. 

This script also includes rudimentary input validation. The operation is aborted, if the given
value is a negative integer, a decimal or a literal.
