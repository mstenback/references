practice_bash
=============
This public repository contains a small collection of Bash-scripts that I wrote as practice. 

1-hello
-------
The simplest of scripts, Hello World. Demonstrates the bare minimum script structure.

2-fibonacci
-----------
This script calculates the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.

3-fibonacci_index
-----------------
This script calculates F(_n_) for the given value of _n_, when _n >= 0_. 
In other words, F(6) equals 8 as it is the 8th number in the sequence. 
The script also demonstrates how to read user input both as command line parameter and in-script dialogue. 
Some looping and flow control structures as well.
